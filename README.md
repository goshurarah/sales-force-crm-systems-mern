# Sales Force Crm Systems
I developed the complete backend for the Sales Force CRM System, a powerful lead management and real estate CRM platform. Using nodejs, express and mongodb, I created APIs to handle features like customizable workflows, pipeline management, task and activity tracking, email/SMS communication, and payment integration with Stripe. I also implemented calendar integration, analytics and reporting, and user role-based permissions. My backend work ensures seamless integration with third-party tools and enables efficient data management to support the React-based frontend.
